# LionPorts
a local repository of ports that are configured for MacOSX Lion and shadow newer incompatible versions of ports 

Lion is the last system that can run on 32bit EFI Apple machines (without tricky modification). It is more full-featured than previous systems (libc is quite up to date and consistent with newer systems, it has libc++ preinstalled, and can run qt5.6 which is a fairly new version of qt5 that enables quite a bit of software to run).
